			<p>
                Flight of the Phoenix is a short, platformer game for people of all ages.
                Take to the skies as a phoenix in search of its lost eggs.
                The journey will not be easy as there are many looming threats along the way.
                Dodge any threats you encounter and make it to the eggs! Good luck!
            </p>

			<p>
                This was a final project between a handful of college students, so the game is fairly small.
                However, we wanted to share the gift of coding and web-design with others, so we posted our source code and assets on GitHub!
                If you'd like to view it, study it, or even download and modify it to make your own levels and mods, feel free!
                The goods are right <a href="https://github.com/arocull/flight-of-phoenix">here</a>.
