# Testing
Note that Firefox and other browsers may block testing locally due to the way modules are imported when in the file system. You will see errors in the console mentioning CORS.

On Firefox, this can be fixed by going to `about:config` in the omnibox, and then changing the preference `privacy.file_unique_origin` from true to false.
